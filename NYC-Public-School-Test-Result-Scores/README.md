# Analyzing-NYC-Public-School-Test-Result-Scores-with-SQL

This project uses summary statistics and filters to analyze test scores across New York City's public schools.

Every year, school test results play a role in deciding the fate of millions of students. In America, the SAT is a major part of the college admissions process.

In this project, I will work with a SQL database containing test performance from NYC's public schools.

The project will look at how performance varies by borough, identify how many schools fail to report information, and find the top ten performing schools across the city!
